# TachiyomiMangaOrganizer
This program has a base y python that merely scan the folders from tachiyomi, makes a custom ComicInfo.xml for Komga or Alfred organization purposes, creates a cbz with all the images + the xml in a folder that is scanned by Komga or Alfred,

Now uses a Json a database, with info like, originfolder, origindestiny, cbz name, Volume, Publisher, and function used to get the comic/manga number

In the future i want to improve all the program, with a web interfaz, change de jsom for some sort of database, and improve funtionalities like:
  - Autodetect Origin and Destiny folder
  - Improve Regedex
  - Notification methods
